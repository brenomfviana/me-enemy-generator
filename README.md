# MAP-Elites Enemy Generator

This program is an Enemy Generator that evolves enemies via a MAP-Elites Genetic
Algorithm.
The output of this program is a set of enemies written in JSON files.

**ATTENTION:**
This program was designed for the game prototype of the Game Research Group of
Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (USP).
Therefore, the designed enemy representation and difficulty function may not
work for other games.

This program can perform two tasks: generate a set of enemies and calculate
the difficulty of an entered enemy.

To generate enemies, this program receives seven arguments:
- [Optional] the save separately flag (`-s`);
  * if the flag `-s` is entered,  then the enemies on the final population
    will be written separately, each one in a single JSON file.
- a random seed;
- the number of generations;
- the initial population size;
- the intermediate population size;
- the mutation chance;
- the mutation chance of a single gene;
- the number of tournament competitors, and;
- the aimed difficulty of enemies.

To calculate the difficulty of a single enemy, this program receives two
arguments:
- the difficulty calculation flag (`-d`);
- the JSON file path of the enemy.
